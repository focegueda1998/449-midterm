# About

This project will act as a way to connect students (previous, current, or future) to track the classes they have taken.
Students sign up with their school email.
Students can register for existing or new classes and say the semester they have taken the class.
You can add new classes to the database.
Users may also search for other individuals who have taken / will take a given class; allowing them to network and collaborate with their peers.
